# Generalized_plant
Design of Generalized plant and controllers

LQG control is a special case of H2 optimal control. Also, the H2 optimal control is a special case of the H-inf optimal control.

The generalised plant of LQG problem is formulated.
In  Gen_plant_b and LQG_Gen_plant_b the case is considered with no reference input (Regulator problem).
In Gen_plant_ref and LQG_Gen_plant_ref the case is considered with a reference input. (Note: these may include computation of H2, Hinf norms. Specific plant designs were also considered as required from qn formulation)

In H_inf_Generalised_plant the H-inf controller design is done. Alternative methods of formulating the generalised plant are also shown
